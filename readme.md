Here are some notes for the project that investigate the speed of directional judgement for component and plaid motion stimuli. The main contributor for this project is Ru-Yuan Zhang, Hao-Jiang Ying, Yang Zhang.

## Instructions



## Files descriptions
* Exp1, Exp2, Exp3 folders correspond to the three experiments that are planned.
* old folder contains some matlab files from a previous paper. They serve as references.


## Motivation and Main idea
* In my previous paper in Scientific Reports, I found duration thresholds for component motion are even higher than plaid motion. This is puzzling given plaid motion stimuli need additional processing stages. In this project, I want to systematically address this problem. 


## Experiment plan
### Exp1
* 50% contrast component vs. 100% contrast (superimposed two 50% contrast component) plaid
* Radius = 8deg, SF = 1deg/cycle, speed = 4deg/s
* Exp1 is exactly the same as in my Scientifi Report Paper

### Exp2
* We need to control contrast and speed
* For contrast, we match the michaelson contrast and RMS contrast
* For speed, we match the speed in a triangle speed regime

## Exp3
* We test a range of spatial frequency and temporal frequency to show the robustness of the effect.
